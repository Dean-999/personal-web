                    <div class="story-content">
                        <p>My 3D modeling skills were actually taught by another designer on our team. Well — "taught" might be too strong a word. All he really did was tell me about a website called Onshape, which we use to design parts for our robotics projects and create 3D models. And that was it! He didn't even send me any beginner materials. (honestly, he probably doesn't even have such a file either) So I went to YouTube to learn, practiced on the website, and whenever I ran into a problem, I would ask him for help. What's really funny is that our team loves giving strange and amusing names to our models. In our project folder, you can find names like "Curly Boy" for a slope where the ball rolls, "Lift Your Baby Up" for a lifting servo system, and "Birds Cannot Fly" for a penguin model. I continued this humorous tradition when I taught the new members. For us, learning and teaching in a fun way makes our whole design team better.</p>

                    <div class="story-content">
                        <p>For me, the journey into UI and coding began almost by coincidence. When I was young, I was more interested in science than technology. However, as I grew older, I realized that science and technology are deeply connected, and neither can exist without the other. Because of this, technology became something I needed to understand rather than avoid. I started exploring well-designed tech products, websites, and applications. While many of my friends focused on learning algorithms and backend structures, I chose a different path—the front end.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Frontend development focuses on designing and programming the interface that users interact with. High-quality products often require smooth animations, meaningful interactions, and strong visual design. After researching this field, I discovered that UI/UX design is the perfect way for me to combine creativity with technical skills. I want to learn tools like Figma, Spline, and Blender to create interfaces, animations, and 3D models that make my websites and apps more engaging and visually appealing.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">At the same time, I've been learning the fundamentals of frontend programming. With the help of AI tools, I've reached the point where I can start developing my own websites and apps. So far, I've built a school–student interaction platform, a personal-website generator called Aspira, a rock identification app, and several other projects. This journey has brought me a great amount of joy and a strong sense of accomplishment.</p>

                    <div class="story-content">
                        <p>My encounter with guitar was because of my interest in music. My parents both like to listen to music. What is different is that my father prefers old-fashion music, like the song in the 80s or 90s, and my mother more appreciates modern style music. For the type of music, they also have opposite ideas. My father likes Metal which is more passionate and exciting, my mother would rather listen to soft and emotional music. Growing in such a music environment really let me keep in touch with utterly different kinds of music. Which kind of shaped my preference of music and laid a good foundation for my further guitar study.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">For my guitar learning, my teacher didn't let me start with cool skills or songs I liked. Instead, he taught me fundamental music theory first. I'm really grateful for that, because it gave me a solid foundation and a deeper understanding of music. It also gave me the ability to create my own melodies and inspired my creativity in art.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Of course, the learning process was not always smooth. I faced many challenges, such as painful calluses on my fingertips from glissando, fingers swelling like radishes, and my lack of finger flexibility. Sometimes my teacher even had to pull my fingers gently to help me stretch them. Despite these difficulties, this journey taught me that practice truly makes perfect, and that music is something that brings me joy whenever I have free time. And it is always me to start my pop music club to teach others and form a band to perform.</p>

                        <p>I am a guy who likes adventure. I have been to mountains, seashores, grasslands and deserts. Every widely different place has variable kinds of rock and minerals. Rock in strange shapes and multicolor fascinates me and it is absolutely a good choice for me to bring back home as a souvenir from my journey. I have a little box to gather my collections and I look upon it as a treasure.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Once I had a journey to a waterfall, I was attracted by the shining rocks. I pick it up, it is translucent and kind of rounded. You know I was so excited that time and I thought I found precious jewellery. I brought it back home and asked my father's friend, who is a jewelry expert. He told me, it is just a piece of glass. I was shocked at that moment and felt really down. Because I already told my classmates that I am becoming a millionaire and I am gonna start my journey travelling around the world tomorrow. And you tell me it is just a piece of glass that only costs 1 dollar? NO WAY! But still, these elegant rocks left me wondering.</p>

                    <div class="story-content">
                        <p>For me, volunteering used to be a word I wasn't very familiar with. Honestly, I had never truly understood sayings like, "We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give." In my mind, volunteering or community service seemed like something only wealthy people did, and I believed that people like me couldn't make any real change. Looking back now, I realize that I was a bit selfish and didn't even have a basic understanding of what service truly meant.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">The turning point came during a visit to the Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, a place that attracts countless visitors from around the world. There, I unexpectedly discovered a complete and well-organized volunteer system open to anyone who wanted to help. I was shocked by how structured and inclusive it was, and I became curious about what volunteers actually did. So, I decided to try it for a day.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">My journey began when I was taken to a large storage room and handed a fluorescent green volunteer jacket and a sign. Then one of the experienced volunteers led me to my station inside a museum designed to show the evolution of pandas and their relatives. My job was simple but meaningful: greeting visitors and helping children find the right activity areas. At first, I felt nervous, but soon people smiled at me, asked me questions, and thanked me for helping. Little by little, I realized that even small tasks could make a real difference. By the end of my shift, I felt not just like a helper, but like a true part of the museum team.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Since then, I've fallen in love with service. It has become meaningful and fulfilling to support others and give back to the community. I have now completed hundreds of volunteer hours, and I am sure I will continue serving others for the rest of my life.</p>
