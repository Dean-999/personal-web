                        <p>
                            My journey from curiosity to academic excellence began with simple questions and genuine fascination. What started as casual interests in mathematics, science, and technology gradually evolved into a deep passion for learning and discovery.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>From Questions to Competitions:</strong> My initial curiosity about how things work led me to explore beyond the classroom. I began participating in math competitions not just to win, but to understand the beauty of problem-solving. Each competition became a learning opportunity, pushing me to think critically and approach challenges from new angles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>From Experiments to Research:</strong> My interest in science transformed into hands-on experimentation. Through science fairs and research projects, I learned that learning isn't just about memorizing facts—it's about asking the right questions, designing experiments, and drawing meaningful conclusions from data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>From Individual Learning to Leadership:</strong> As my interests deepened, I realized that true learning happens when you share knowledge with others. Founding Science Olympiad and leading tech teams taught me that teaching others is one of the most effective ways to solidify your own understanding and inspire collective growth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>The Continuous Cycle:</strong> Today, my interests continue to drive my learning. Every new project, competition, or leadership role is an opportunity to explore deeper, learn more, and apply knowledge in meaningful ways. The cycle of interest → exploration → learning → application → deeper interest continues to fuel my academic journey.

                        <p><strong>Math:</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            In my math journey, I was always the top student in my class. Those high scores and the praise from my teacher made me a little overconfident about my real math level. When my teacher learned that I was going to study abroad, he recommended that I try the AMC. Honestly, the first test I took—the 2023 AMC 10A—was not that bad. Luckily, it had a lot of geometry questions, which happened to be my strength. The result satisfied me, and I started to believe I was such a genius that I didn't even need to practice to make AIME easily, or even earn a top 5% award. Youth made me believe I was gifted, until life taught me that there is always someone stronger and always another height to reach.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The next year, I came to the US for high school, and of course AMC was the competition I chose without hesitation. But I still didn't prepare. I expected another high score—until reality struck me hard. For the first time, I couldn't even understand some of the questions because I was no longer taking the translated Chinese version. Unsurprisingly, I completely failed. My score was not even half of what I got the year before. I was shocked when I saw my classmates easily score higher than my previous result. That was the moment I realized I was not naturally gifted—and that there was a huge amount of knowledge waiting for me to learn.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From then on, I decided to take AMC seriously. I filled three notebooks covering every topic in AMC 10 and even AMC 12. I practiced every test from 2015 to 2024 and reviewed every question I got wrong. Luckily, heaven rewards those who work hard. I scored a 136.5, which placed me in the top 1% for AMC 10 and top 5% for AMC 12. This taught me that improvement is never about talent—it is built slowly, through patience, with enough effort, and the courage to face my problem.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Science:</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            My interest in science started from a young age. While traveling, I was always curious—how bridges stood so firmly across rivers, why deserts could be extremely hot in the day but freezing at night, or how different climates shaped the landscapes I saw. All the different natural phenomena, fascinating architecture, and amazing foods I experienced deeply attracted me. At that time, I didn't know that science had many different fields — so I simply called everything I liked "science."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here I want to share the story of how I prepared my science fair project. My project is a portable mineral-recognition system that uses computer vision and dust-sensing to identify rocks more accurately in the field. When I first started reading related articles, I found many unfamiliar materials and scientific terms. I had to use a notebook to record everything I didn't understand and figure out what each part was for and why I needed it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After solving the knowledge problems, the mechanical connections and coding tests became my biggest challenges. For example, when connecting the Raspberry Pi to the PM sensor, I needed to make sure the Pi's GPIO output matched the sensor's input, and sometimes I even had to consider voltage issues because certain components required extra power. I spent a lot of time managing the wiring, checking every GPIO connection, and testing each section of code to make sure the hardware responded correctly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once everything was connected, I began running experiments and collecting data to analyze the results. Of course, I failed many times along the way, but after hundreds of hard attempts, I finally achieved the outcome I had been working for.
